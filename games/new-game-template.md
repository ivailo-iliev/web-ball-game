# Creating a New Mini-Game

This template documents the public engine hooks, helpers, and conventions used by the existing games. Follow these steps to add a new entry under `games/` without modifying the engine.

## 1. File scaffold

Create `games/<your-game>.js` and wrap the code in an IIFE so no new globals are leaked. Destructure utilities you actually use from `g.u` to keep the file concise.

```js
(function (g) {
  'use strict'; // optional, but matches pinata.js and avoids accidental globals

  const { between, pick, rand } = g.u;

  g.Game.register('<your-game-id>', g.BaseGame.make({
    icon: 'ðŸŽ®',
    max: 6,
    rRange: [25, 90],
    vRange: [10, 180],
    spawnDelayRange: [0, 3],
    emojis: ['ðŸ˜€', 'ðŸ˜Ž'],

    onStart() {
      // optional: run once after the engine calls init()
      // e.g. compute grid dimensions or tweak this.cfg values per run
      // this.cfg.rRange = [40, 40];
    },

    spawn() {
      // must return a descriptor with at least x and y
      return {
        x: rand(this.W),
        y: rand(this.H),
        e: pick(this.cfg.emojis)
      };
    },

    move(sprite, dt) {
      // optional: advance sprite state every frame
      sprite.x += sprite.dx * dt;
      sprite.y += sprite.dy * dt;
    },

    onSpriteAlive(sprite) {
      // optional: called when the spawn animation ends
    },

    onHit(sprite, team) {
      // optional: return true to skip the default pop animation
    },

    onMiss(sprite) {
      // optional: respond when a sprite leaves the playfield or expires
    }
  }));
})(window);
```

Use `Object.assign(target, source)` when merging configuration or styles, as seen across the existing games (`pinata.js` copies motion values, `fruits.js` updates falling sprites). The engine already merges your configuration with its defaultsâ€”only override what you change.

## 2. Available configuration fields

You can pass the following properties to `BaseGame.make({ ... })`. They merge with the engine defaults, so only override the fields your game needs.

| Field | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `icon` | string | Emoji shown on the launcher button. |
| `max` | number | Maximum concurrent sprites. Set to `0` when you fully manage spawning (see `pinata.js`). |
| `rRange` | `[min, max]` | Radius range for spawned sprites. Used if the descriptor omits `r`. |
| `vRange` | `[min, max]` | Speed range used when the descriptor omits `dx`/`dy`. |
| `spawnDelayRange` | `[min, max]` | Seconds between automatic spawns. Return `null` from `spawn()` when nothing should appear (no free holes, etc.). |
| `emojis` | string[] | Default artwork pool if the descriptor omits `e`. |
| `burst` / `burstN` | string[], number | Emoji burst visuals played on hits. |
| `winPoints` | number | Optional score target that ends the match. `Infinity` by default. |
| `gameMinutes` | number | Optional time limit (minutes). Set when running the game. |
| `collisions` | boolean | Enables spriteâ€“sprite collision resolution. |
| `bounceX` / `bounceY` | boolean | Enables wall reflection on the respective axis. |

Avoid redefining engine defaults you do not needâ€”`Object.assign` already merges your overrides with `baseCfg`.

## 3. Sprite descriptors & helpers

`spawn()` must return an object with at least `x` and `y`. You can supply additional fields the engine understands:

- `r`, `dx`, `dy`, `e` â€“ override radius, velocity, and emoji. Omit any of these to let the engine derive them from the configuration (`balloon.js`, `fish.js`).
- `angle`, `scaleX`, `scaleY` â€“ initial transform values; `pinata.js` adjusts `angle` every frame to swing the piÃ±ata.
- `ttl` â€“ lifetime in seconds. When it reaches zero the sprite counts as a miss (`mole.js`).
- `type` or other custom fields â€“ safe to add; they stay on the sprite instance and are used heavily by `fruits.js` and `pinata.js` to branch behaviour.
- `s` â€“ plain object of style properties merged via `Object.assign(sprite.style, s)`.
- `p` â€“ plain object of CSS custom properties applied with `style.setProperty` (`gem.js`, `mole.js`).

To create additional sprites in reaction to events (chain reactions, bursts), call `this.queueSpawn(descriptor)` from within your game logic. The engine adds the descriptors on the next animation frameâ€”see `_spawnCandies` in `pinata.js`.

You can also create persistent sprites immediately with `this.addSprite(descriptor)` when you need a long-lived actor (e.g. the swinging piÃ±ata). The returned sprite object can be extendedâ€”`pinata.js` attaches a custom `draw()` implementation so the rope stays aligned. Remember to keep references on `this` if other hooks need them later.

## 4. Lifecycle hooks & instance state

`BaseGame` calls these hooks if they exist on your game instance:

1. `onStart()` â€“ after `init()`, once per run. Use it to compute derived values (`fruits.js` computes its grid, `mole.js` sizes the board) and to mutate `this.cfg` for per-run tweaks.
2. `spawn()` â€“ whenever the engine needs a new sprite and `this.sprites.length < this.cfg.max`. Return `null` if nothing should spawn (no free holes in `mole.js`).
3. `move(sprite, dt)` â€“ every frame per sprite. Use it to integrate physics (`balloon.js`, `pinata.js`) or resolve cascades (`fruits.js`). Keep it lightweight.
4. `onSpriteAlive(sprite)` â€“ when the spawn animation finishes and the sprite becomes hittable. `fruits.js` uses this to link sprites into its grid.
5. `onHit(sprite, team)` â€“ on pointer hits. Return `true` to prevent the default removal (`gem.js` delays collection until a gem is fully revealed, `pinata.js` keeps the piÃ±ata alive).
6. `onMiss(sprite)` â€“ when a sprite leaves the play area or expires; use it to clean up bookkeeping (`mole.js` frees a hole when a mole times out).

You have access to `this.sprites` (all active sprites), `this.cfg` (merged configuration), `this.container` (the DOM element for the playfield), and helpers such as `this.emitBurst(x, y, emojis)` for custom particle effects. Use the `team` parameter supplied to `onHit` to apply team-specific scoring logic; the engine already updates the scoreboard and ripple effect.

## 5. Patterns and best practices from existing games

- **Keep state on the game instance.** Store collections like `this.grid` (fruits) or `this.holes` (mole) during `onStart()` so hooks share data without globals.
- **Use `Object.assign` for targeted updates.** `pinata.js` resets candy motion with `Object.assign(sprite, {...})` and `fruits.js` merges falling sprite properties. Avoid replacing entire objects the engine owns.
- **Prefer engine helpers over manual DOM work.** Use `this.emitBurst`, `this.queueSpawn`, and `this.addSprite` for new actors. When DOM nodes are needed, attach them to `this.container` and cache references on the game instance (`gem.js` stores collection columns, `pinata.js` caches the piÃ±ata sprite).
- **Respect engine responsibilities.** Let the engine handle score increments, sprite removal, ripple effects, and lifecycle transitions. Games never override `init`, `loop`, `hit`, `miss`, or `end`.
- **Keep per-frame logic minimal.** Cache expensive calculations, reuse `Math` helpers, and exit early when work is unnecessary (`fruits.js` skips checks when no matches are pending).
- **Clamp spawning to available space.** Check capacity before spawning and return `null` when the board is full (`mole.js`, `fruits.js`). The engine will wait and retry.
- **Tune with constants.** Define configuration objects or `Object.freeze`d maps at the top of the file to document gameplay knobs (`pinata.js`). Reuse pure helper functions for clarity (`fruits.js` splits logic into `_collapseColumn` and `_checkMatches`).
- **Keep CSS modular.** When a game needs specific styling, add it to `styles/<game>.css` and toggle via class names or CSS variables set on `this.container` (`mole.js` writes `--holeN` values, `gem.js` animates reveals with `--mr`).
- **Clean up mirrored state.** If you mark external data when spawning, clear it in both `onHit` and `onMiss` so resources become available again (`mole.js` frees hole occupancy in both hooks).
- **Stay within the documented interfaces.** Do not add new hooks, mutate engine prototypes, or import other modules. Use only `g.Game`, `g.BaseGame`, `g.Sprite`, and `g.u` APIs.

## 6. Restrictions

- **Do not modify** `game-engine.js`, `app/utils.js`, or any other engine files.
- **Do not override** engine methods other than the documented hooks. Leave `init`, `loop`, `hit`, `miss`, and `end` untouched.
- **Do not introduce new globals or interfaces.** Keep everything inside the module scope returned by the IIFE.
- **Do not duplicate engine responsibilities.** Scoring UI, burst animations, sprite removal, ripple effects, and timing are already handled by the engine.
- **Do not bypass existing helpers.** Stick to provided utilities (`g.u`, `this.emitBurst`, etc.) instead of reimplementing them.

By following this templateâ€”and studying the patterns aboveâ€”you can create new games that plug cleanly into the shared engine while preserving compatibility with the existing launcher and scoring logic.
